# Abstractive-Text-summarization-on-Movie-Reviews-using-PEGASUS

There has been a recent uptick in the popularity of over-the-top (OTT) video streaming services, yet many viewers still check the film's IMDB rating and classification before deciding to watch it. With the use of abstractive text summarization, this project will provide users with a tailored synopsis of the selected film, informed by their watching habits and preferences.
Consider the case of a movie buff who already has a 10-film viewing history but is open to suggestions. The IMDB user reviews were used to create a unique synopsis of the new film.
In this case, the problem of abstractive text summarization has been solved by using the PEGASUS pre-trained transformer model. The summarizing process uses the specialized XSum PEGASUS model to provide a one-line synopsis of the whole entered material.
